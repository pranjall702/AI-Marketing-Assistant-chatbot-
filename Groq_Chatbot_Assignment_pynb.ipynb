            "6. **Build a support network**: Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your goals, and who can provide encouragement and accountability.\n",
            "7. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories along the way to stay motivated and encouraged.\n",
            "8. **Stay positive and focused**: Maintain a positive mindset, and remind yourself that setbacks are a natural part of the journey.\n",
            "9. **Be kind to yourself**: Don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter obstacles or make mistakes. Instead, learn from them and move forward.\n",
            "10. **Stay accountable**: Share your goals and progress with a friend or mentor and ask them to hold you accountable.\n",

            "* **Be resilient**: Develop a growth mindset and see challenges as opportunities for growth.\n",
            "* **Focus on the process, not just the outcome**: Enjoy the journey, learn from it, and appreciate the progress you're making.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some popular techniques to stay determined include:\n",
            "\n",
